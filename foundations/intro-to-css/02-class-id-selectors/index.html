    <!-- * **All odd numbered elements**: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts containing `Verdana` and `DejaVu Sans` with `sans-serif` as a fallback
    * **The second element**: blue text and a font size of 36px
    * **The third element**: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px
    * **The fourth element**: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold

    Quick tip: in VS Code, you can change which format colors are displayed in RGB, HEX, or HSL by hovering over the color value in the CSS and clicking the top of the popup that appears!
